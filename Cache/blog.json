Even then the gift, be it the Battle Pass, a new Outfit, etc., will not become available on iOS or Android (via Google Play) once received.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size:18px\"><strong>Why doesn\u2019t Epic capitulate to Apple\u2019s demand to remove Epic direct payment?</strong></span><br />\n<br />\nEpic believes that you have a right to save money thanks to using more efficient, new purchase options. Apple\u2019s rules add a 30% tax on all of your purchases, and they punish game developers like us who offer direct payment options.<br />\n<br />\n#FreeFortnite<br />\n<br />\nMore questions?

Put your driving skills to the test in the new Tilted Taxis LTM!&nbsp;Spawn in a taxi and challenge other cabbies for passenger pick-ups and drop-offs to be among the best drivers on the road.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"14BR TiltedTaxi Social\" src=\"https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/14br-tiltedtaxi-social-1920x1080-890562588.jpg\" style=\"height:auto; width:auto\" /><br />\n<br />\nTo reach victory, be the first to collect the target number of driver rating stars. Passenger drop-off requests (Fares) give a different amount of stars depending on the distance. BUT: it\u2019s not just about the destination \u2014 it\u2019s also about the journey. Earn bonus stars for pulling off a passenger\u2019s special task: boost, ram another taxi, arrive without a scratch, go airborne, go wild.<br />\n<br />\nDon\u2019t worry about having a lead foot: in this LTM, taxis have infinite fuel. And if you wanna take the fight to your rivals the old-fashioned way, hop out of your taxi and grab an item for some ground-based combat. When you\u2019re ready to get behind the wheel again, jump back into your taxi or hop in a new one.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFare well on the road ahead!</p>\n",
